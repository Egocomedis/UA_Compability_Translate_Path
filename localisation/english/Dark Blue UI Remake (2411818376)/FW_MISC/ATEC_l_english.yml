 ATEC_guide_Decline: "§ETechnology Decline:§!\nSome unfinished §HAdvanced Research Projects§! progress will decay over time, as will some completed ones. \nFor the completed §HAdvanced Research Project§!, its title color and the color of the icon vertex triangle determine its decline indicator. \n\n§BBlue§! means never decay. \n§HYellow§! means that it will not decay under certain conditions. \n§RRed§! means that it will always decline, and such projects require constant investment of $ATEC_Points$ to maintain their progress."

 ATEC_guide_Stuck: "§RStuck Points: §!\nIf the breakthrough probability is lower than 100%, the progress may be stuck. The lower the probability of breakthrough, the easier it is to encounter stuck points. \n§YStuck Points will significantly slow down research progress. §!"
